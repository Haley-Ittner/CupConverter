// Develop a program from scratch
/* Purpose: Convert temps in Celcuis, Farenhiet and Kelvin to each other. 
Want to loop until user is done. Going to use methods to do so.
Using global variables to get around returning more than 1 value from a method.

//DUE OCTOBER 10th


// Ask user the kind there temp is in
// PSUEDO CODE: Prompt for kind input. Read the kind. OR prompt q to exit.
  // scale = askForScale();

// Ask user the temp
// PSUEDO CODE: Prompt for temp to convert from. Read the temp.
   temp = askForTempurature();

// Calculate the converted number
// PSUEDO CODE: Convert from input temp kind to the other two temp kinds. 
   convertTempurature(temp, tempTwo);
   

// Output the input values, the input kind and coverted temps
//PSUEDO CODE: Same as above.
   displayResults(scale, temp, kelvin, farenhiet, celcius);
// Give a message if temp is below absolute 0
//PSUEDO CODE: Same as above.

// PSUEDO CODE: Go back to the top from here.

//CROSSED OFF BELOW WITH WHAT WAS ADDED TO THE FIRST PROMPT
// Ask if user wants to convert again
// PSUEDO CODE: Prompt the user if they want to continue. Then, ask for yes or no.
